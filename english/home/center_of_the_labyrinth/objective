[32mObjective:
	Concatenate the contents of the five regular files in this directory, (files
	whose names do not begin with '.'), in alphabetical order according to their
	names. Then, store the result in a file called 'key' (remember, the
	objective file is one of these five files).  Finally, place the 'key' file
	into a directory called '/home/center_of_the_labyrinth/lock' (you must
	create this directory).[0m
