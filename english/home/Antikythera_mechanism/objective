[32mObjective:
	Create the '~/submission_box/solution' script. The script should accept an
	arbitrary number of arguments, treating each as a file path. If a file does
	not exist in the system, the script must create it. The script should set
	both the Last Access and Last Modification timestamps of each file to
	'1970-01-01 00:00:00.000000000 +0000'. If an error occurs while creating or
	modifying a file (e.g., due to lack of permission), the script must continue
	processing the remaining files. The script must never output anything to
	the standard output (stdout), or standard error (stderr).[0m
